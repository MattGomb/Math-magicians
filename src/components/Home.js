        Mathematics
      </h3>
      <p className="passage">
        Mathematics is the abstract science of number, quantity, and space.
        Mathematics may be studied in its own right (pure mathematics),
        or as it is applied to other disciplines such as physics and engineering
        (applied mathematics). Mathematics is essential in the natural sciences,
        engineering, medicine, finance, computer science and the social sciences.
        The fundamental truths of mathematics are independent from any scientific experimentation,
        although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena.
        Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed
        in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under
        applied mathematics.
        Other mathematical areas are developed independently from any application
        (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but practical applications
        are often discovered later.
        A fitting example is the problem of integer factorization, which goes back to Euclid,
        but which had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem
        (for the security of computer networks).

        The Calculator
      </h3>
      <p className="passage">
        Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models
        to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers.
        They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of integrated circuits
        reduced their size and cost. By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point
        where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.
        Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included interactive
        calculator programs such as dc and hoc,
        and interactive BASIC could be used to do calculations on most 1970s
        and 1980s home computers. Calculator functions are included
        in most personal digital assistant (PDA) type devices.
        In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets.
        For example, there are scientific calculators
        which include trigonometric and statistical calculations.
        Some calculators even have the ability to do computer algebra.
        Graphing calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the real line,
        or higher-dimensional Euclidean space.
        As of 2016, basic calculators cost little, but scientific
        and graphing models tend to cost more.
        With the very wide availability of smartphones, tablet computers
        and personal computers,
        dedicated hardware calculators, while still widely used,
        are less common than they once were.
        In 1986, calculators still represented an estimated
        41% of the world&aposs general-purpose
        hardware capacity to compute information.
        By 2007, this had diminished to less than 0.05%.
